/**
 * This annotation is used to inject Models (Classes annotated with 
 * {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.UseModel @UseModel}).
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * The injection process loads the models from different means (Ex. DB or Network), depending
 * of the description provided to the model itself when it was declared. It is automatically
 * executed when the Enhanced Component is loaded (at least that {@link lazy()} be set to true, 
 * or {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.LoadOnEvent @LoadOnEvent}}) be provided).
 * This process can be triggered with the action {@link com.dspot.declex.Action.$LoadModel $LoadModel}.
 * It can be also triggered with {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.UpdateOnEvent @UpdateOnEvent}
 * or {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.PutOnEvent @PutOnEvent}
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * Models can be also "put". This mechanism permits to store or send the model
 * through different interfaces (Ex. DB or Network). This mechanism can be triggered
 * with the action {@link com.dspot.declex.Action.$PutModel $PutModel}. 
 * It can be also triggered with {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.PutOnEvent @PutOnEvent}
 * or {@link com.dspot.declex.annotation.PutOnAction @PutOnAction}.
