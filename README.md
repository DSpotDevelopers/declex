[![DecleX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/smaugho/declex/img/Declex144.png)](https://github.com/smaugho/declex/wiki) 

DecleX is a powerful framework which reduces the verbosity of Java language, and enhances the dependencies/views injections
to permitting the creation of Android applications at record speeds. 
It is totally based on <a href="https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki" target="_blank">AndroidAnnotations</a>; 
in a similar fashion, we want to facilitate the writing and the maintenance of 
Android applications to the highest level which has not been achieved up to now.


## Documentation

Please consult our Wiki in https://github.com/smaugho/declex/wiki

## Configuration

Place the following lines in your app module build.gradle file:

```gradle

dependencies {
    annotationProcessor 'com.dspot:declex:2.0.a.24'
    implementation 'com.dspot:declex-api:2.0.a.24'
    implementation 'com.dspot:declex-actions:2.0.a.21'
}

```

And that's it!...

>If you need to use the configuration for the old version of Android Application Plugin with 'android-apt' you can check it here: [Old Android Application Plugin Configuration](android_application_old.md)
